            “No one who cooks cooks alone. Even at her most solitary a cook
            in the kitchen is surrounded by generations of cooks past...”
            - Laurie Colwin
        </aside>
        <p>This collection is dedicated to my mother, Clara Sonntag, who blessed us with many wonderful dishes and tasty
            treats, and who still inspires me. It was collected for her children and grandchildren and their families. I
            have named the collection, “What’s Kuchen?”, in recognition of our German heritage and the influence that
            heritage had on us as cooks. I have included as many “heirloom” recipes as I could find, meaning those our
            mothers and grandmothers prepared for us. I hope that each of you will find among these recipes some that
            stir memories of your childhood.
        </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, most of Mother’s recipes were lost years ago. After her death, I was able to recover from her
            last home in Hurst only a few Lone Star Gas Company bulletins, from which she often cooked. I have
            personally kept recipes since my junior high school years, many of them my mother’s. One of my favorites,
            and possibly the oldest in the collection, MOTHER’S OATMEAL CRISP COOKIES , is dated 1950, when I was five
            years old. Some of the recipes are dated in their methods and/or in their ingredients, but that’s part of
            their charm. I have changed them only where required for clarity.
        </p>
        <p>I want to express my appreciation to my sisters, Carla Everhart and Julie Bohmfalk, who are great cooks, for
            sharing their recipes throughout the years. I’ve enjoyed many of them; others I’ve not yet tried. The
            collection includes many more recent recipes as well, including several from my son and daughter-in-law. I
            am grateful to all those who have generously shared their recipes and have acknowledged my source for each
            recipe where known. Perhaps some of you will add your own recipes to this collection.
        </p>
        <p>Recipes are generally not very instructive. They are sometimes cryptic and often assume a level of expertise
            that some have not yet attained. For this reason, I have included hints, techniques and opinions in a
            section titled “HOPEFULLY HELPFUL HINTS“, and have cross-referenced many recipes to hints and techniques
            that may be helpful in their preparation.</p>
        <p>I have come to believe that appreciation and encouragement from one’s loved ones is an important element in
            becoming an accomplished cook. Dad encouraged Mother with constant praise of her culinary efforts. I want to
            thank my own family for their encouragement of my efforts throughout the years. Likewise, I encourage each
            of you to be supportive of the culinary efforts of your loved ones.
